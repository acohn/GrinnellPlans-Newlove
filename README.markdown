GrinnellPlans Newlove Script
============================

This is a script that lets you easily find newly added planlove on your quicklove page. It runs under the Greasemonkey extension to Firefox.

Installation
------------

1. You will need to be using Firefox (or Opera) to use this script.

2. You need to install the Greasemonkey extension if you don't have it already. Greasemonkey allows user-generated scripts like mine to modify how pages are displayed. It has a lot of neat uses besides my script. You can find it at http://www.greasespot.net/.

3. Now that you have Greasemonkey installed, you're ready to add my script. [Click here](http://github.com/youngian/GrinnellPlans-Newlove/raw/master/newlove.user.js). A box should show up asking you if you want to install the script. Do so. If the box doesn't show up, click on Tools->Greasemonkey->Install User Script... (you must first navigate to the script for this option to not be grayed out).

4. Now go to your quicklove page. A box should pop up asking for your username. Assuming it has guessed correctly, click 'Ok' and you're all set. Check out Usage below for more options. 

Usage
-----

The script runs every time you open your quicklove page. It will only show planlove that is different from the last time the page was opened. There are a couple options you should know about. You can find both of these by navigating to Tools->Greasemonkey->User Script Commands...

_Save as unread_ saves the most recent newlove as unread, so it will still be shown next time you view the page. Useful if you haven't had a chance to look through all of your newlove or need to refresh the page for some reason.

_Reset username_ clears the stored values for your username and old planlove, as if it were a fresh install. Use this if you entered the wrong username by mistake or something.
